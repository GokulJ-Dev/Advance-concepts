# Advance-concepts

My coding practices and learning advance concepts.

# Parcel:

    1) Dev build
    2) Local server
    3) Hot module replacement
    4) Tree shaking
    5) Good dev experience -  Error handling
    6) Image optimisation
    7) Caching previous builds for faster performance

    ^ - caret - updates the packages to minor versions
    ~ - tilde - updates the packages to major versions

# JSX

    1) Markup + Logic
    2) Xml or html like syntax which also holds JS functionality
    3) attribute name should be in camelCase
    4) JSX -> ReactElement -> Object -> HTML elements (while render)
    5) JS operations are performed inside the curly braces

# Parcel + Babel (transpiler)

    - Parcel bundler have babel which is a transpiler which converts JSX to JS which browser can undrestand.

# Components

    1) Class based components
    2) Functional Components - js function which return some peice of jsx from it.

    RULES: Should start with Capital letter.
           root.render(<Component />)

# Component Composition

    Rendering one component inside the other component.
